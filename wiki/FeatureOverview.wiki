== Ideas ==
  # Quick Fix: Wrap marked text into span with concordion command
  # Code completion for variable names
  # Generate fixture from HTML (generate referenced method)
  # Generate HTML from template for fixture
  # Partial document validation support
  # Eclipse 3.7 support (issues: validation doesn't work at all)
  # Recognize `@FullOgnl` on fixtures and change/disable expression validation accordingly
