  # Syntax validations for all expressions
  # Recognize `@FullOgnl` on fixtures and change/disable expression validation accordingly
  # Code completion for partial namespace prefix should offer proposals not only for the prefix but for all available commands (e.g. `co|` -> `concordion:assertEquals`)

== Future ==
  # Code completion for variable names
  # Generate fixture from HTML
  # Generate HTML from template for fixture
  # Partial document validation support
  # Eclipse 3.7 support (issues: validation doesn't work at all, icons can't be loaded)
